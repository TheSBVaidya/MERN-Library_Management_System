# Library Management System (LMS) - React, Android, & Node.js

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

This is a full-stack Library Management System project featuring a multi-frontend architecture served by a single robust backend. The system provides three distinct interfaces tailored to the roles of **Admin**, **Librarian**, and **User**.

-   **Admin & Librarian Portals**: A comprehensive web application built with **React.js**.
-   **User Client**: A native mobile application built with **Java for Android**.
-   **Backend API**: A central RESTful API powered by **Node.js and Express.js** that serves all three frontends.

## Features

This project is divided by user roles, with features designed to meet the needs of each group.

### User Features (Android App)

-   **ðŸ‘¤ Secure Authentication**: Register and log in with a JWT-based system.
-   **ðŸ“Š Personalized Dashboard**: Get an at-a-glance view of borrowed books and due dates.
-   **ðŸ”Ž Advanced Book Search**: Search the library catalog by title, author, ISBN, or subject.
-   **ðŸ“– Book Details & Availability**: View detailed book information and real-time copy availability.
-   **ðŸ“š Borrowing History**: Track currently borrowed books and past borrowing history.
-   **ðŸ”§ Profile Management**: Update personal information and change passwords securely.

### Admin & Librarian Features (React.js Web App)

-   **ðŸ‘‘ Role-Based Access Control**: Separate dashboards and permissions for Admins and Librarians.
-   **ðŸ“š Book & Inventory Management**: (Admin) Add, update, and remove books and individual copies from the library catalog.
-   **ðŸ‘¥ Member Management**: (Admin) Onboard new members, manage user profiles, and view borrowing history.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the entire project running locally.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) & npm
-   [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
-   A running [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/downloads/) server

### 1. Backend Setup
#### 1. Clone the repository and navigate to the backend directory 
    git clone [https://github.com/TheSBVaidya/MERN-Library_Management_System.git] cd your-repo-name/backend

#### 2. Install dependencies
    npm install

#### 3. Create a .env file and add your database and JWT configuration
    DB_HOST=localhost
    DB_USER=your_mysql_user
    DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
    DB_NAME=your_database_name
    JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key

#### 4. Initialize the database with the provided .sql schema file

#### 5. Start the server
    npm start

### 2. Web Frontend Setup (React)
#### 1. Navigate to the React app directory from the root folder
    cd ../react-admin-librarian  #<-- Change this to your folder name

#### 2. Install dependencies
    npm install


#### 3. Start the React development server
    npm start

### 3. Mobile Frontend Setup (Android)
#### 1. Open the android-user directory (or your folder name) in Android Studio.
#### 2. Allow Gradle to sync dependencies.
#### 3. Important: In your RetrofitClient.java file, update the BASE_URL to your computer's local network IP address (e.g., http://192.168.1.10:3000/api/). localhost will not work from the emulator.
#### 4. Build and run the app on an Android Emulator or a physical device.
